- 👋 Hi, I’m @learnpagain
- I am retired and I am learning Python. For me, Python is the new Basic. From the early 80's to 2015, I developed data office applications for a community college extension office.  Changed programming tools to MS MS OFFice and  Visual Basic in 2000. Web pages first hand coded in XHTML/CSS and then VB ASP.Net in 2005.
